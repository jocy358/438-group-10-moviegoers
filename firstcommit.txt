hello, this is my first commit on my branch. we are thinking of creating some sort of movie review oe movie logging service for our project.
since lecture one, we created a group chat on slack and created this repository with some branches.
following next lecture, we will continue to plan out what exactly we want to include in our project.
one thing that stands in the way for me is setting up react native, as i've heard some people have issues when setting it up with macOS. I hope to spend some time working on this over the weekend.
