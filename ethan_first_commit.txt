This will be the first commit for the project
The basic idea we have is some sort of movie/tv show review service
What we have accomplished so far is setting up some basics with having a group chat on Slack and the repository
We plan on discussing the features of the project for the final product to work on
The biggest challenge we will probably face starting off is setting up some sort of plan for the future as we continue onwards
