# Overview

This is a movie reviewing application where you can search for and request movies with the help of [this](/https://www.omdbapi.com/) API

We got styling help for this document from [this guide](/https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) 
Introduction

## How was communication managed
We communicated in person during class time after lecture, as well as through a slack group chat
    
## How many stories/issues were initially considered, how many stories/issues were completed
We originally had 23 issues, of which we were able to complete around 13

My role was to help find and set up the API, as well as to create unit tests with some minor styling tasks.

- What was the biggest challenge?
  
By far the biggest challenge during this project was attempting to get Jest working for the unit tests
- Why was it a challenge?
  
There were many dependency errors when attempting to set it up, to the point where even if it did function, it would break the rest of the app entirely.
- How was the challenge addressed?
  
I was unfortunately not able to get the tests working, but was able to leave my files for them in the repo. I learned a lot about trying to manage dependencies and learning when to switch objectives.
- Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  
I really enjoyed using the API to fetch movies and their respective posters, as well as stylizing the app pages.
- If you could do it over, what would you change?

I would set up testing before anything else in the project to avoid dependency conflicts.
- What is the most valuable thing you learned?

I learned to "give up" on and switch on issues that aren't working out earlier. I think I spent too much time trying to figure Jest out, which demoralized me and burnt me out as well as ate up a lot of time I could've used to contribute in other areas.

My role was to create a profile page for uers as well as create the page for displaying information about individual movies.

- What was the biggest challenge?
  
The biggest challenge for me was figuring out how to work with react.
- Why was it a challenge?
  
While I had worked with android apps, javascript, and web development in previous classes, react proved to be difficult to wrap my head around since it doesn't work exactly like any of them while also utilizing many of the things I have worked with.
- How was the challenge addressed?
  
I am very thankful for my teamates as they figured out a lot of the things I had struggled with, allowing me to learn from the way they went about thinks and incorporate that into my own code.
- Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  
My favorite part of this project was being able to create something that I could see change in real time. Unlike in other classes, developing this project allowed me to easily see what each part of my code affected.
- If you could do it over, what would you change?

If I could do this project over, I would have liked to add more features to the pages I made, since we did not end up implementing some planned functionality.
- What is the most valuable thing you learned?

The most valuable thing I learned is that steady progress is a better way to tackle a project, rather than trying to do everything at once like I usually do.

My role was to help setup the Database in order to store the information about users and movies.

- What was the biggest challenge?

The biggest challenge for me was trying to interact with the database. Getting the right information from it in order to be displayed was always a struggle, even at the end when there was a small issue with the posters.

- How was the challenge addressed?

Talking with the group about the issue and trying to figure out why it happened was a great benefit. Afterwards, reviewing the code helped with seeing why it acted in such a way and how to properly fix it.

- Favorite / most interesting part of this project

My favorite part probably came from the implementation of the search and its interaction with the movie page. Making sure that code could search through the API, place it in the database, then take the information out was crucial for it all to work. Once it did work though, it created a satisfying end result.

- If you could do it over, what would you change?

Probably my biggest change I would make is the implementation of further more quality of life features. I inititially thought of showing all movies reviewed, but it never came to fruition. There were also the actors and, most definitely, the genre object and table that was vere used in the end due to its difficulty with the API we had.

- What is the most valuable thing you learned?

I would say the most valuable thing I learned was the distribution of work and cooperating with each step. Making sure we were clear in our specific goals to not overlap too much made it all very smooth. We could take our steps without worry and then come together at the end.

# Conclusion

## How successful was the project?
The project was very successful, while we had to downscale on some aspects of user interactivity, we achieved what we set out to do with a reliable search and review function on the app.

## What was the largest victory?
    
## Final assessment of the project
