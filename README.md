# Overview

This is a movie reviewing application where you can search for and request movies with the help of [this](/https://www.omdbapi.com/) API

We got styling help for this document from [this guide](/https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

My role was to help find and set up the API, as well as to create unit tests with some minor styling tasks.

## What was the biggest challenge? 
By far the biggest challenge during this project was attempting to get Jest working for the unit tests
## Why was it a challenge?
There were many dependency errors when attempting to set it up, to the point where even if it did function, it would break the rest of the app entirely.
## How was the challenge addressed?
I was unfortunately not able to get the tests working, but was able to leave my files for them in the repo. I learned a lot about trying to manage dependencies and learning when to switch objectives.
## Favorite / most interesting part of this project
I really enjoyed using the API to fetch movies and their respective posters, as well as stylizing the app pages.
## If you could do it over, what would you change?
I would set up testing before anything else in the project to avoid dependency conflicts.
## What is the most valuable thing you learned?
    I learned to "give up" on and switch on issues that aren't working out earlier. I think I spent too much time trying to figure Jest out, which demoralized me and burnt me out as well as ate up a lot of time I could've used to contribute in other areas.
    

# Conclusion

## How successful was the project?
        The project was very successful, while we had to downscale on some aspects of user interactivity, we achieved what we set out to do with a reliable search and review function on the app.
    What was the largest victory?
    Final assessment of the project
